## Setup

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) `v8.10.0` or above and NPM or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

#### 1. Install Zeit CLI

```
npm i -g now
```

or

```
yarn global add now
```

#### 2. Login to Zeit CLI

```
now login
```

#### 3. Clone this repo and install dependencies

```
git clone git@github.com:airswap/airswap-vercel-example.git
cd airswap-vercel-example
yarn install
```

#### 4. Create a `.env` file in the root of this directory, modeled after `.env.example`

Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file in the root directory. The following must be set:

- `ETHEREUM_ACCOUNT` - The private key of an account to use for staking and trading.
- `ETHEREUM_NODE` - The URL of an Ethereum node to connect to.

There is an example `.env.example` that you can copy to `.env` to start with.

### Ethereum Account

To use an existing Ethereum account, set the `ETHEREUM_ACCOUNT` in your `.env` file. Otherwise it's easy to create an account using MetaMask or the `yarn utils:account` script in the [Maker Kit](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-maker-kit) repository. Paste the generated private key into your `.env` file.

### Ethereum Node

To use an existing Ethereum node, set the `ETHEREUM_NODE` in your `.env` file. Otherwise you can create a free account with INFURA. Navigate to https://infura.io/ to create an account and generate an API key and URL.

## Commands

| Command   | Description                    |
| :-------- | :----------------------------- |
| `yarn`    | Install dependencies           |
| `now dev` | Run the maker locally          |
| `now`     | Deploy your maker to the cloud |

## Quick Start

The reference Node.js maker is configured to quote `WETH/DAI` at price `0.1` on port `3000`.

### Testing your ZEIT maker Locally

1. From the root of this directory, run `now dev`
2. In another command line window, navigate to [Maker Kit](https://github.com/airswap/airswap-maker-kit)
3. Make sure that you've also created an appropriate `.env` in `maker-kit`
4. Run `yarn peers:get`, press enter through all prompts except "locator". When asked for locator, specify `http://localhost:3000`
5. Observe that your Zeit Serverless function successfully serves a quote successfully!

### Deploying your ZEIT Maker to the cloud

1. From the root of this directory, run `now`
2. That's all there is to it!

## Connecting to a remote server

In some cases it may not be feasible to develop all of your pricing logic inside your ZEIT maker. Maybe your pricing logic is already developed in another programming language, or you have pre existing infrastucture. In these cases, you can simply use ZEIT serverless as a proxy layer that sits between the end user and your remote pricing server. This creates a nice seperation of concerns. The ZEIT maker will handle web details such as CORS and SSL, and it will forward quote/order requests to your remote server for processing.

Follow the steps below to see a demo of this proxy configuration.

1. In `now.json`, change the value of the `"dest"` field on line 16 from `"/api/index.ts"` to `"/api/index.proxy.ts"`
2. In a command line window, run `yarn mock-price-server` to start a mock server locally on port `1337`
3. In another command line window, run `now dev` to start the ZEIT process on port `3000`
4. Now, whenever you query your maker on port `3000`, you'll see that all the requests get proxied to the mock pricing server.

## Notes

- **CORS** - Makers must run their servers with CORS enabled to accept connections from in-browser web applications including AirSwap Instant.
- **Token Values** - All token values are in the smallest indivisible units of a token (wei).
- **Nonce Window** - Each order is identified by a unique nonce. The "nonce window" is the time within which every order returned will include the same nonce. This can be configured to prevent overexposure.
- **Trading ETH** - Swap only supports tokens, not native ether (ETH). To trade ETH it must be wrapped (WETH).
